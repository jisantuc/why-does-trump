Asking the hard questions about @realDonaldTrump and tweeting about it

_update December 2017_: this has been inactive for a bit. For some reason
the twitter API started rejectng tweets from the lambda function, and I
never dug into it. It's still around for posterity / in case you'd like to
consider some deep questions yourself.
